This is to create a mock version of "Airbnb", called Windbnb - with dummy data. It was recomennded that we either use React or Vue. I did this with just plain Javascript.

### Struggles
- Fetching the data with the fetch API. Faced [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45696999/fetch-unexpected-end-of-input) issue.
   - Left a branch open for this: `Fetch-EOI-issue` [link](https://github.com/pamdayne/wind-d-bnb/tree/Fetch-EOI-issue)

### Experiences

### Learned/Improved
- Learnt about grid `repeat` usage `grid-templace-column: repeat(3, 31%)`

- CSS/SCSS
- Packaged with (ParcelJS)[https://parceljs.org/]
- Others: PostCSS
